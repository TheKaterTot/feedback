Mod 2 is the perfect opportunity for you to become the developer you want to be.
When a topic interests you, research it. Don't wait for it to come up in class.
It might never come up in class. Keep yourself engaged in every project, especially
the tutorials. Check the homework every night and don't miss an assignment. Learn
HTML and CSS, even if (like me) you don't care about aesthetics. Mod 2 gives you
freedom to be creative and be yourself. Never miss a chance to be uniquely you;
it will make you a better developer. As always, may The Force be with you.
